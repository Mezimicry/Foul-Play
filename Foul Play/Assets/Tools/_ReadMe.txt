This folder is for things that aren't used in the game but instead to be used when making it
Its probally best to open this folder in explorer and then run things instead of doing from unity as things might go wrong
Also put an explainer in this file so others know how things work



Foul Play Script Generator
This a python script made to generate the VN scripts the game uses
When opened a termininal will open up where you have to type what you want to happen
Most commands are explained in VN_Scripts however some are exclusive to the generator

101. Delete previous line
Used to undo a mistake instead of fixing after the script in generated

999. End Program
Will place your new script into the created script file
Paste this into the VN_Scripts file and now it can be called
Don't leave anything in the created script file as it will be replaced next time a script is made
